## Install

Download the latest install or stand alone version from [releases](https://github.com/aero530/uniterm/releases).

## Roadmap

* History of text/bytes sent - Keep history of last 10 or so list of bytes sent from the bottom text input box and have a drop down menu to allow a user to select from the previous list.
* Improve ANSI support - Currently only properly supports forground / background color escapes.  Could use something like https://crates.io/crates/vte or https://crates.io/crates/vtparse
